      <p>After studying computer science at California Baptist University, I have gained a deep understanding of the fundamental principles and practices of software engineering. I have learned how to design, develop, and deploy software systems using various programming languages, tools, and frameworks.
        <br>
        <br>One of the most valuable skills I acquired during my time at CBU was the ability to think critically and solve complex problems using logic and analytical reasoning. This skill has proved invaluable in my academic and professional pursuits, allowing me to approach challenges with confidence and a clear understanding of the problem at hand.
        <br>
        <br>In addition, I have learned the importance of collaboration and communication in software development, which are essential skills in a team-based environment. Through group projects and assignments, I have honed my ability to work with others, share ideas, and receive feedback constructively.
        <br>
        <br>Overall, my time studying computer science at CBU has been a transformative experience that has equipped me with the knowledge, skills, and confidence to pursue a successful career in software engineering. I am grateful for the opportunities I have had and the guidance of my professors, who have helped me to reach my full potential as a computer scientist.
