    <h2>NeuroLeap summer '23</h2>
    <div class="grid-container">
      <p>During my internship with NeuroLeap, a company that uses neuroscience technology to improve brain function, I gained valuable experience in web development and database management.
        <br>
        <br>As an intern, I was responsible for building and maintaining the company's website using HTML and CSS, ensuring that it was user-friendly and visually appealing. Additionally, I used NodeJS to create interactive features such as contact forms and chatbots to improve user engagement.
        <br>
        <br>I also worked on implementing a database system using SQL to store and manage patient information, which was a critical component of the company's operations. This involved creating tables, designing queries, and ensuring the integrity and security of the data.

      <p> In addition to technical skills, the internship also taught me important soft skills such as time management, problem-solving, and adaptability. These skills have proven to be essential in my academic and professional pursuits, and have helped me to become a more well-rounded individual.
       <br>
       <br>Overall, my web development internship was an incredible opportunity that allowed me to gain practical experience and to learn from experienced professionals in the industry. It has given me a competitive edge in the job market and has helped me to become a more confident and capable developer.
