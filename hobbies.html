      <p>When I'm not studying computer science, I enjoy exploring my other passions, such as music, basketball, and spending time with my family. Music has always been a big part of my life, and I love playing the guitar and listening to different genres of music. It's a great way for me to unwind and express my creativity outside of the technical world of computer science.
        <br>
        <br>In addition to music, I also enjoy playing basketball with friends and family. It's a fun and active way for me to stay healthy and competitive, and it helps me to maintain a balanced lifestyle.
        <br>
        <br>Lastly, spending time with my family is also a top priority for me. I enjoy catching up with my parents, siblings, and grandparents whenever I can. Whether it's going out to eat, watching a movie, or just hanging out, I always treasure the moments I spend with them.
        <br>
        <br>Overall, these hobbies and activities allow me to recharge and take a break from my studies, while also providing me with opportunities to grow and learn in other areas of my life.
