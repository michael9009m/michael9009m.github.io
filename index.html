  <h2>Who am I?</h2>
  <div class="grid-container">
    <p>I am a computer science student currently pursuing my degree at California Baptist University. My passion for software engineering began early in my academic career, and I have been eager to learn and develop my skills in this field ever since.
      <br>
      <br>I have always been fascinated by the intricate workings of software systems and their ability to solve complex problems. As I progressed through my coursework, I found myself drawn to the challenges of designing efficient algorithms and developing robust software applications.
      <br>
      <br>In addition to my academic studies, I have also participated in various coding competitions and hackathons, where I have had the opportunity to work with other like-minded individuals and develop my programming skills in a collaborative setting.
      <br>
      <br>I am constantly seeking out new challenges and opportunities to further my understanding of software engineering and its applications in real-world scenarios. My ultimate goal is to use my skills and knowledge to make a positive impact on the world around me by creating innovative software solutions that benefit society as a whole.
